He is developing a straightforward style and after he had his first enthusiasts, he just couldn’t stop. He also had the awesome opportunity to play at “The Beach” (Bucharest), Corvin (Budapest), Alandala (Cluj-Napoca) and to have a project with Vlad Arapasu. It’s not just some beats and a deep bass rumble, with the music he tries to reach a greater range of emotions and we would be glad to share them with you.',
